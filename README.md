Created a weather Dashboard that simply searches the forecast for any city input.

Shows current weather, including UV index, temp, wind speed, and humidity.
Also shows five day forecast with dates.
Keeps a history of searched cities, with a clear history button.
Saves history to local storage using JSON.
